# NashWD-1C

# HTML Spacing

### Setup
1. Inside your `coding` folder that you created, create a new directory called `NashWD-1C`. USE THE TERMINAL COMMANDS WE JUST LEARNED!!! If you need help, reference this: [TERMINAL HELP](https://github.com/sarah-codebug/NashWD-1A)
1. Now, make a new file called `spacing-issues-1.html` in the `NashWD-1C` directory you just created. 
1. Hold the `command` key and click on the `spacing-issues-1.html` link above to open it in a new tab. 
1. Then navigate to the tab you just opened and click the `RAW` button on the right side of the page. 
1. Copy all of the HTML from this page and paste it into the `spacing-issues-1.html` file you just created on your computer. Then, open the file in Sublime.
1. Go back to your Terminal window and use the `open spacing-issues.html` command to open the HTML page in Chrome. If that doesn't work, just navigate to the file in Finder, and right-click on `spacing-issues.html`, then `Open With`, then `Google Chrome`. 
1. You'll notice that when you look at the HTML page in the browser, everything looks great (for a page that has no styling). But even though on the outside everything looks great, the inside (code) is a disaster!

### The Code
1. Now let's check out the code. In Sublime, you'll want to open the `spacing-issues-1.html` file and see how ugly the code looks. 
1. I bet you've already guessed what we are going to do — format the HTML elements correctly. Woohoo!
1. Read through the [HTML STYLE GUIDE](https://github.com/sarah-codebug/html-style-guide) to get an understanding of how HTML pages should be formatted. 
1. Then take what you've learned and apply it to the `spacing-issues-1.html` page. Format all the HTML code correctly. Make sure you intermittently refresh the page in Chrome to ensure you haven't messed anything up. 
  *Make sure you save your `spacing-issues-1.html` file in Sublime. Remember the trick where the filled-in circle by the filename means you have unsaved changes, and the small x means your file has been saved.* 
1. Once you feel like your HTML is formatted correctly, open up the RAW version of the `correct-1.html` page. The steps to open this RAW page are the same as when we did it for the `spacing-issues-1.html` page. 
1. Compare your work. Look very closely and make sure that all of your indentations are correct. 
1. Congratulations! You've just seen what it's like to work with a developer who doesn't space correctly :)!
1. Continue through the same steps for `spacing-issues-2.html` and `spacing-issume-3.html`!
