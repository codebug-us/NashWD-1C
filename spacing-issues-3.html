<h1>Outer space</h1>
        <p>There are a few things about space that everyone needs to know exist.
    </p>
<div class='facts'>
    <h4>Facts</h4>
          <ul>
<li>
        Space is completely silent. Since there's no atmosphere in space, sound has no medium to travel through, which makes it eerily silent...to us.
</li><li>99% of our solar system's mass is the sun</li><li>More energy from the sun hits Earth every hour than the world uses in an entire year. 

  </li>
        <li>If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space, they will bond and permanently stick together.
                                                                                                              </li> 
        <li>The closest planet to the sun is not the hottest. Venus is actually hotter than Mercury due to it's thick clouds that trap the earth's heat</li>
  </ul>
